There's a reason it's called a comfort zone and not a "boring zone" or a "bad zone." It's comfortable. It feels safe. You know what to expect.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I've been deliberately stepping outside mine — learning to code, writing publicly, building things I'm not qualified to build. And I keep catching myself wanting to go back.

## The pull of what you know

When I'm struggling with something new, there's always a voice that says: "You could just go back to what you're good at. Nobody asked you to do this."

This? This is just me deciding to try.

## What I've noticed

The discomfort isn't constant. It comes in waves. The first five minutes of trying something new are the worst. Then you get curious. Then you get absorbed. Then you look up and realize you've been at it for two hours.
