I've spent most of my career doing things I was qualified for. Things with clear expectations, defined outcomes, and a path someone else already mapped out.

That's not a bad thing. But at some point I started wondering — what would happen if I tried something I had absolutely no business trying?

## The moment it clicked

It wasn't dramatic. I was sitting at my desk, looking at a tool I wished existed, and thought: *what if I just tried to build it?*

I didn't know HTML. I didn't know CSS. I definitely didn't know JavaScript. But I'd been hearing about vibe coding — this idea that you can describe what you want to an AI and it writes the code for you.

So I tried it. And something happened that I wasn't expecting: it worked. Not perfectly. Not beautifully. But it *worked*.

## What I'm learning

The biggest thing I've learned so far isn't about code. It's about permission. I spent a long time waiting to feel ready before trying new things. Turns out, you never feel ready. You just start.

> You don't need permission to learn something new.

That's become kind of a mantra for me. Not in a motivational-poster way. More in a quiet, practical way — like reminding myself it's okay to not know what I'm doing.

## What's next

I'm going to keep building things. Keep writing about what I'm learning. Keep being bad at things until I'm less bad at them.

If you're reading this and you've been waiting to start something — maybe this is your sign. Or maybe it's just a blog post. Either way, thanks for being here.
