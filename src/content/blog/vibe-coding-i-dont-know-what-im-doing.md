Let me be upfront: I am not a developer. I don't have a computer science degree. I couldn't write a for-loop from memory if you asked me to.

And yet — I've been building things. Real things. Things that run in a browser and do what I want them to do. How? By talking to AI and telling it what I want.

## What is vibe coding?

The short version: you describe what you want to build in plain language, and AI writes the code. You look at the result, say what's wrong, and it fixes it. Back and forth until it works.

It sounds too simple. And honestly, it kind of is — until it isn't. The hard part isn't the code. The hard part is knowing what you actually want.

## My first project

I wanted a dashboard to track some things at work. Nothing fancy — just something visual instead of another spreadsheet.

I described it: "I want a clean dashboard with cards showing progress on different projects, a budget tracker, and a timeline view."

Twenty minutes later, I had something on screen. Was it perfect? No. Did I spend another two hours tweaking it? Yes. But the point is — I went from zero to *something* in less than an afternoon.

## What surprised me

The thing nobody tells you about vibe coding is that it teaches you to think clearly. When you have to describe exactly what you want, you realize how vague your ideas usually are. It's like design thinking, but for building software.

I'm still learning. Every project teaches me something new. And I'm okay with that.
