It was a Saturday afternoon in the mountains of Oregon. I had just spent the day at Hoodoo Ski Resort, with a morning lesson followed by hours of practice on the slopes. By 3 PM, I was ready to head home. I climbed into my Honda, pulled onto Highway 20 toward Corvallis, and pressed play on my audiobook, *Empire of AI* by Karen Hao. Snow was falling steadily, and the road ahead glistened with ice. But everything felt serene, just another winter drive through the Cascades.

Then, in an instant, everything changed.

I approached a curve too fast. I don't remember exactly what I was doing, what lapse in attention caused me to misjudge the speed on that icy mountain pass. All I remember is slamming the brakes. Within seconds, my car careened out of control, spinning across the road into the opposite lane. I hit a snow marker post, and then the car went off the edge.

I was falling.

As the car plummeted down the wooded cliff, only one thought filled my mind: *I'm done.* I didn't scream. I didn't panic. I just sat there, wondering how much further the car would fall, and whether I would survive.

Then the car stopped. Lodged between the trees. Still. Silent.

In that fleeting moment of stillness, survival instinct took over. I grabbed my phone, pushed the door open, and climbed out before the car could slide any further into the ravine. I scrambled up the muddy slope, through ferns and fallen branches, pulling myself back up to the road.

When my feet hit the pavement, something washed over me. This was not the first time I had come close to death, but this time felt different. The first two times, I recovered and moved on. This time, I couldn't ignore it anymore. It was as if God had reached down and said, *I've saved you three times now. What are you going to do with this life?* I looked at my hands. I looked at my legs. They were whole. Unscathed. I was alive.

A car pulled over almost immediately. Three people stepped out: a counselor, a firefighter, and their friend, a nature enthusiast who knew the names of every plant around us. They rushed toward me and asked if I was okay. I tried to appear calm, told them I was fine. But inside, I was still shaking from the adrenaline.

There was no cell signal on that stretch of highway, only satellite. The man climbed down to my wrecked car, turned off the engine, and brought back my keys, my water bottle, and my lunch box. His girlfriend helped me text 911 through satellite. They invited me into their warm car to wait for the police.

While we sat there, other cars pulled over too, drivers rolling down windows to ask if we were alright. I was overwhelmed by how many good people were willing to stop for a complete stranger.

Looking back, it almost feels like the universe sent me exactly the right people. The firefighter knew how to handle the situation calmly and safely. His girlfriend, the counselor, sat with me and talked me through the fear. And their friend, the plant lover, lightened the mood with funny, endearing stories about the plants growing around us. They didn't know me. I had nothing to offer them. We didn't share a background or even a native language. And yet, they stayed.

That moment taught me something I carry with me now: no matter what life throws at me, be kind to people. It is the only way I know how to reciprocate all the kindness I have received throughout my life.

Then I saw it.

Across the road, partially hidden by the trees, stood a small wooden cross, a roadside memorial for someone who had died on that very stretch of highway.

My stomach dropped. That cross was my worst-case scenario. That could have been me. In a different second, a different angle, a slightly faster speed, my name could have been on a cross just like that one.

But instead of fear, I felt gratitude. Gratitude toward the person whose name was on that cross. Gratitude toward God, my guardian angels, and my ancestors. I believe that in my moment of peril, something beyond me was holding that car in place.

Sitting in that warm car that afternoon, staring out at the snow-covered mountains, my mind was flooded with thoughts. I thought about all the years I had lived inside a box, choosing safety, avoiding risk, keeping my dreams at arm's length. I had always known I wanted more. I wanted to build a startup. I wanted to do business, to surround myself with brilliant minds, to work in a big city like San Francisco. I wanted to travel the world, date a competent man, and make a name for myself. But I kept talking myself out of it, always finding reasons to take life easy, to stay complacent, to settle for the comfortable path.

And I made a decision.

I have to do something extraordinary. I have to become successful enough to give back, to repay every act of kindness I have ever received. No more excuses. I had almost lost everything on that mountain pass, and I was still making deals with myself about why it wasn't the right time.

I was done shrinking myself to fit a safer, smaller life.

This accident didn't just wake me up. It reaffirmed something I had always felt but never fully acted on: I want to live a life worth this third chance. I want to help as many people as I can, the same way strangers helped me when I had nothing to offer them in return.

About two hours later, the State Police and a tow truck arrived. The three strangers who had stayed with me shook my hand and said goodbye. We may only cross paths once in this lifetime, but I will carry their kindness with me forever.

The young officer was kind too. After filing his report and making sure my car would be towed to Sweet Home, he offered me a ride back to Corvallis, over an hour away. He said he was stationed in Albany, so it was on his way.

And just like that, I had my first-ever ride in a cop car.

Not in handcuffs. Not in trouble. Just a twenty-nine-year-old woman in a ski overall and an OSU Beaver hoodie, watching the snow fall through the window, heading home to start a new life.

Two days later, something compelled me to go back. I drove the same highway, this time with a bouquet of flowers in the passenger seat. I needed to say thank you to the person who rested in that place.

I pulled over, walked across the road, and laid the flowers by the cross. I did some research and learned that the man had passed away in a motorcycle accident in 2022. He was a Lebanon, Oregon local who had always loved riding, a graduate of OIT who later worked at OSU, the very same university where I work.

The coincidence still gives me chills. Out of all the places on that long, winding highway, my car landed near the memorial of a man who walked the same campus I walk every day. Maybe it was just chance. But part of me believes he was watching over me that afternoon.
