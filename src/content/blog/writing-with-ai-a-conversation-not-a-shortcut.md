When I tell people I write with AI, they usually assume I mean AI writes *for* me. That's not what's happening here.

What I actually do is closer to having a conversation. I'll start with a messy thought — something I've been chewing on — and talk it through with AI the way I might talk it through with a friend. Except this friend never gets tired, never judges, and asks really good follow-up questions.

## How it actually works

I'll start by saying something like: "I've been thinking about why it's so hard to start new things when you're already established in a career. Can you help me explore that?"

And then we go back and forth. The AI pushes me to be more specific. I push back when it goes somewhere I don't mean. Slowly, the idea takes shape.

The writing that comes out is mine. The thinking that got me there was a collaboration.

## Why this matters to me

I've always wanted to write but never felt like a "writer." Using AI as a thinking partner lowered the barrier just enough. I didn't need to face the blank page alone.

That doesn't make the writing less real. If anything, it makes it more honest — because I'm actually saying what I think instead of getting stuck on how to say it.

## A note on transparency

You'll notice I mention AI throughout this site. That's intentional. I'm not trying to hide it. Using AI as a tool is part of my story — it's how I'm learning, building, and writing. Pretending otherwise would defeat the whole purpose of this site.
