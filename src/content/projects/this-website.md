I had been thinking about building a personal website for a long time. I wanted a space of my own to showcase my work, share what I'm learning, and write about the things I care about, from travel to AI to everyday experiences. The idea of blogging was inspired by a previous boss who had a website where he shared stories of hiking across the Pacific West Coast. I thought, why not create something like that for myself?

This was my first vibe coding project. I had no web development experience and didn't even know what Astro was before I started. I built the entire site with Claude as my partner. Claude gave me step-by-step instructions, generated the code, and reviewed my progress through screenshots I sent along the way. It felt like having a private instructor sitting right next to me. What surprised me most was learning to work with the terminal. I used to think you had to go to GitHub's website to upload your code, but now I push updates, install tools, and deploy from the command line on my Mac. The stack behind this site includes Astro, Node.js, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Netlify, all things I learned from scratch through this process.

For now, I'm focused on writing more blog posts and testing what this site can be. Eventually, I plan to add more features to make it more engaging and user-friendly. This project is far from finished, but that's kind of the point.
